							<h2><strong> I Am A Programmer</strong> </h2> 
						</header>
						<p> 
							<br> Ever since I was a kid, I loved playing with computers. My interest grew when I started my career as a sales consultant. While I was not in an IT role, I was very keen on the technical aspects such as data management and maintaining
							the sales channels effectively. This passion led me to major in Computing during my undergraduate studies. Throughout my education, I latched on to any project ideas I could get my hands on so that I could study new programming languages.
						</br> 
							<br> Today, I have mastered the arts of JavaScript, PHP, C++, jQuery, HTML5, CSS, AngularJS and MySQL. 
						</br>
						    <br> Currently, I am pursuing further studies specializing in Cyber Security and Networking as I know that there is certainly much more which I would like to learn and achieve in my journey as an IT enthusiast.
						 </br>
							<br> I will be a significant asset to the next organisation with the transferrable skills I have gained throughout the 4 years as a Customer Service Advisor.
